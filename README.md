# DSA 210 Football Player Valuation Project

## 1. Project Proposal
Analyzing the Determinants of Football Player Market Value

### Motivation
FootballÂ player market valuations can vary greatly depending on a variety of criteria, including on-field performance, age, position, league quality, and more. By focusing on these characteristics, I hope to get insight into which factors have the greatest influence on how players are valued in the transfer market. This study will not only help me improve my data science skills, but it may also provide insights for teams, scouts, and fans looking to evaluate player worth more objectively.

### Data Source and Collection

#### Data Sources:

Transfermarkt for estimated market values, player profiles (age, position, nationality).
FBref (or WhoScored) for player performance metrics such as goals, assists, minutes played, and passing accuracy.
Potential Kaggle datasets if they cover similar data in a ready-to-use CSV format.

#### Collection Plan:

##### Scraping: 
Use Python libraries to extract market values and stats from Transfermarkt/FBref, ensuring compliance with their terms of service or manually extracting data from them.
##### CSV Downloads: 
If I find an appropriate Kaggle dataset containing both performance statistics and market values, I may opt to download it directly.
##### Data Merging: 
Match players across sources by name and/or ID. Handle name variations (e.g., special characters, abbreviations).

### Analysis & Methods
- Data cleaning steps.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Hypothesis tests (e.g., correlation between goals and market value).
- Predictive modeling (e.g., regression or random forest).

### Limitations & Future Work
- Discuss potential data quality or availability issues.
- Outline possible expansions (like adding injury data or advanced metrics).
